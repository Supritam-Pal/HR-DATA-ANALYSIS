## 📌 Project Overview
The **HR Data Analysis** project focuses on transforming raw employee data into meaningful business insights.  
Using **Excel**, **SQL**, and **Power BI**, the project analyzes workforce demographics, employee performance, attrition rate, job satisfaction, salary structure, and overall HR KPIs to help organizations make better people-driven decisions.

This project demonstrates the complete workflow of HR analytics — from raw data cleaning to dashboard creation.

## 🧩 Project Work / Workflow

### **1️⃣ Data Understanding**
- Loaded the raw HR dataset (`HR DATASET.xlsx`)
- Understood columns such as:
  - Employee ID  
  - Age, Gender  
  - Department  
  - Salary, Job Role  
  - Attrition  
  - Tenure  
  - Performance Rating  
  - Education, Marital Status, etc.

### **2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
Performed in **Excel** and **SQL**:
- Removed duplicates and blank records  
- Standardized categorical fields  
- Fixed inconsistent formatting  
- Replaced missing values with appropriate logic  
- Converted data types (numeric, categorical, dates)  
- Ensured all records matched business rules for analysis

### **3️⃣ SQL Data Analysis**
Ran several SQL queries to explore the dataset:
- Department-wise employee distribution  
- Average salary by job role  
- Attrition count and rate  
- Tenure analysis  
- Performance rating distribution  
- Finding patterns between salary, satisfaction, and attrition  

SQL was used to derive cleaned and structured tables used later for dashboard reporting.

### **4️⃣ Power BI Data Modeling**
- Imported cleaned dataset into Power BI  
- Built data model with relationships  
- Created calculated columns & DAX measures:
  - Attrition Rate  
  - Active Employees  
  - Avg. Salary  
  - Avg. Tenure  
  - Employee Count by Department  

### **5️⃣ Power BI Dashboard Development**
Designed an interactive HR dashboard showing insights such as:

#### ⭐ Key KPIs
- Total Employees  
- Attrition Count & Attrition Rate  
- Average Monthly Income  
- Average Satisfaction Score  
- Workforce Distribution  

#### 📊 Visuals Included
- Age distribution  
- Salary range analysis  
- Department-wise employee count  
- Attrition by gender, age group, and department  
- Job role vs. salary comparison  
- Employee satisfaction & performance metrics  

The dashboard allows HR professionals to quickly identify:
- Departments with high attrition  
- Areas needing retention strategies  
- Salary imbalances  
- Workforce demographic trends
